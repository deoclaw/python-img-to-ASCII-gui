# Python IMG to ASCII Converter (with GUI)
This is a simple python program that takes an image and converts it to text in ASCII or Unicode with 8-bit or 1-bit depth using GUIZero.

Created for a small creative project I am working on.

Type in what width to resize the image, whether the output text will use ASCII or Unicode shaders, 8-bit or 1-bit, and then click the convert button to select your image and save your text file.

## To Run
1. Have python already installed on your machine or install python and pip3 (python package manager)
> Note: Linux users, Ubuntu-based specifically, may need to also install `python3-tk` if there is an issue importing `tkinter` with `guizero`
2. Download the files from github or fork the project. 
3. If needed/desired, create and activate a virtual environment and then install requirements by running the below:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the program in your terminal. A GUI should appear for ease of use.

## Future Updates
Future updates will plan to have an executable file.
