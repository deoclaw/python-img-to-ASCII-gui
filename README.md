# Python IMG to ASCII Converter (with GUI)
This is a simple python program that takes an image and converts it to text in ASCII or Unicode with 8-bit or 1-bit depth using GUIZero.

Created for a small creative project I am working on.

Type in what width to resize the image, whether the output text will use ASCII or Unicode shaders, 8-bit or 1-bit, and then click the convert button to select your image and save your text file.

## To Run
1. Have python already installed on your machine or install python.
2. Download the files from github or fork the project. 
3. If needed, create an environment or download the necessary packages in requirements.txt
4. Run the program in your terminal

Future updates will plan to have an executable file.
